definitions. -}

-- add :: Int -> Int -> Int
-- add x y = x + y

add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
add = \x -> (\y -> x + y)

{- add is a function that takes an integer x and returns a function, which
in turn takes another integer y and returns that result x + y. -}

{- Secondly, lambda expressions are also useful when defining functions that
return functions as results by their very nature, rather than as a consequence
of currying. -}

{- The library function const that returns a constant function that always 
produces a given value

        -- const x _ = x

const :: a -> (b -> a)
const x = \_ -> x

{- Finally, lambda expressions can be used to avoid having to name a function 
that is only referenced once in a program.

        -- odds n = map f [0..n-1]
                    where f x = x*2 + 1

odds n = map (\x -> x*2 + 1) [0..n-1]


-- 4.6 Operator sections
{-
Functions such as + that are written between their two arguments are called 
operators.

Any operator can be converted into a curried function that is written before 
its arguments by enclosing the name of the operator in parentheses, 
as in (+) 1 2.

This convention also allows one of the arguments to be included in the 
parentheses if desired, as in (1+) 2 and (+2) 1. 

In general if # is an operator, then expressions of the form (#), (x #), and 
(# y) for arguments x and y are called sections. 
        (#) = \x -> (\y -> x # y)
        (x #) = \y -> x # y
        (# y) = \x -> x # y

Sections have three primary applications. 
    First of all, they can be used to construct a number of simple but useful 
    functions in a particularly compact way.
        (+) is the addition function \x -> (\y -> x+y)
        (1+) is the successor function \y -> 1+y
        (1/) is the reciprocation function \y -> 1/y
        (*2) is the doubling function \x -> x*2
        (/2) is the halving function \x -> x/2

    Secondly, sections are necessary when stating the type of operators, 
    because an operator itself is not a valid expression in Haskell. 
        (+) :: Int -> Int -> Int

    Finally, sections are also necessary when using operators as arguments to 
    other functions. 
        sum :: [Int] -> Int
        sum = foldl (+) 0
